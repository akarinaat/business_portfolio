The purpose of this report is to address the transportation theme. Taxi prices have risen up lately. We have noticed this in the past few months as it is the usual way of transportation of the sales department employees.

The reason why these expense have gone up, has to do with political matters our country has been going through lately The federal government has been shut down indefinitely and the economy has suffered an instability period. The prices on gasoline have reached the top since the last crisis. 

Our human capital make use of this mobility resource to go meet clients, get new businesses and in general, bring new opportunities for the company. So it is considered to be extremely necessary for them to have a way of transportation provided for the company as it is part of their contract.

The way we can approach this inconvenient is by giving all the sales department employees a company bus card with unlimited usage. That way the company can deduce it from taxes and it wouldn’t loose business.

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Sales Department Manager.</p>

          <p>Dear Mr. Johnson,</p>

We have received your complaint letter about the faulty boots you got from one of our stores. We already sent the complaint to our supplier and they explained the reason why this happened was because they were running out of the usual cords and the machine took the ones that were left behind. We already took action on this situation and I would like to thank you for letting us know.

We are terribly sorry about this experience you had with us and would love to make it up to you.

If you could provide us with your address, we would be more than happy to send you a new pair of boots with the highest guarantee we have. This would be completely free. 

In REI we care a lot about our clients and in addition to that, we are offering you 30% discount in your next three purchases in our stores around the US.

Once again, we apologize for this, and we can assure you, this will never happen again.

 

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Karina Amador,</p>
